<p>
    In March of 2019, my partner and I went skiing with another couple who never skied. 
    It was very exciting! Since we have had a decent amount of experience, I had told the couple 
    to follow the ski tips I posted above- plus more.
    Unfortunately, they didn't follow the first and foremost tip above, which is EXERCISE
    to build stronger muscles and endurance.  
    Physical training before skiing builds your strength to avoid excessive soreness and injury.
    Thankfully, our friends were totally fine- aside from a small fall:
    <br>
    Sometimes, when you have even a small tumble in soft snow without physical strength to pick yourself up,
    the SNOWMOBILE crew helps you out ðŸ˜‚
    <br>
    <br>
    Please notice that she's laughing HYSTERICALLY and completely fine!
